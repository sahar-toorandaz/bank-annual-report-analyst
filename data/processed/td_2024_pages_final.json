    "text_final": "Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nFrom time to time, the Bank (as defined in this document) makes written and/or oral forward-looking statements, including in this document, in other filings with Canadian regulators\nor the United States (U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and in other communications. In addition, representatives of the Bank may make forward-looking statements\norally to analysts, investors, the media, and others. All such statements are made pursuant to the “safe harbour” provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements\nunder, applicable Canadian and U.S. securities legislation, including the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited\nto, statements made in this document, the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“2024 MD&A”) in the Bank’s 2024 Annual Report under the heading “Economic Summary\nand Outlook”, under the headings “Key Priorities for 2025” and “Operating Environment and Outlook” for the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth\nManagement and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking segments, and under the heading “2024 Accomplishments and Focus for 2025” for the Corporate segment, and in other\nstatements regarding the Bank’s objectives and priorities for 2025 and beyond and strategies to achieve them, the regulatory environment in which the Bank operates, and the Bank’s\nanticipated financial performance.\nForward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “will”, “would”, “should”, “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “estimate”, “plan”, “goal”, “target”,\n“may”, and “could”. By their very nature, these forward-looking statements require the Bank to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, general and\nspecific. Especially in light of the uncertainty related to the physical, financial, economic, political, and regulatory environments, such risks and uncertainties – many of which are beyond\nthe Bank’s control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict – may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements.\nRisk factors that could cause, individually or in the aggregate, such differences include: strategic, credit, market (including equity, commodity, foreign exchange, interest rate, and\ncredit spreads), operational (including technology, cyber security, process, systems, data, third-party, fraud, infrastructure, insider and conduct), model, insurance, liquidity, capital\nadequacy, legal and regulatory compliance (including financial crime), reputational, environmental and social, and other risks.\nExamples of such risk factors include general business and economic conditions in the regions in which the Bank operates (including the economic, financial, and other impacts of\npandemics); geopolitical risk; inflation, interest rates and recession uncertainty; regulatory oversight and compliance risk; risks associated with the Bank’s ability to satisfy the terms of the\nglobal resolution of the civil and criminal investigations into the Bank’s U.S. BSA/AML program; the impact of the global resolution of the civil and criminal investigations into the Bank’s\nU.S. BSA/AML program on the Bank’s businesses, operations, financial condition, and reputation; the ability of the Bank to execute on long-term strategies, shorter-term key strategic\npriorities, including the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions and integration of acquisitions, the ability of the Bank to achieve its financial or strategic objectives with\nrespect to its investments, business retention plans, and other strategic plans; the risk of large declines in the value of the Bank’s Schwab equity investment and corresponding impact\non TD’s market value; technology and cyber security risk (including cyber-attacks, data security breaches or technology failures) on the Bank’s technologies, systems and networks, those\nof the Bank’s customers (including their own devices), and third parties providing services to the Bank; data risk; model risk; fraud activity; insider risk; conduct risk; the failure of third\nparties to comply with their obligations to the Bank or its affiliates, including relating to the care and control of information, and other risks arising from the Bank’s use of third-parties;\nthe impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws, rules and regulations, including without limitation consumer protection laws and regulations, tax laws, capital\nguidelines and liquidity regulatory guidance; increased competition from incumbents and new entrants (including Fintechs and big technology competitors); shifts in consumer attitudes\nand disruptive technology; environmental and social risk (including climate-related risk); exposure related to litigation and regulatory matters; ability of the Bank to attract, develop, and\nretain key talent; changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices; downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of ratings assigned by any rating agency,\nthe value and market price of the Bank’s common shares and other securities may be impacted by market conditions and other factors; the interconnectivity of Financial Institutions\nincluding existing and potential international debt crises; increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding; critical accounting estimates\nand changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by the Bank; and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events and claims resulting from such events.\nThe Bank cautions that the preceding list is not exhaustive of all possible risk factors and other factors could also adversely affect the Bank’s results. For more detailed information,\nplease refer to the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2024 MD&A, as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders and news releases (as\napplicable) related to any events or transactions discussed under the headings “Significant Events” or “Significant and Subsequent Events” in the relevant MD&A, which applicable\nreleases may be found on www.td.com.\nAll such factors, as well as other uncertainties and potential events, and the inherent uncertainty of forward-looking statements, should be considered carefully when making\ndecisions with respect to the Bank. The Bank cautions readers not to place undue reliance on the Bank’s forward-looking statements. Material economic assumptions underlying the\nforward-looking statements contained in this document are set out in the 2024 MD&A under the headings “Economic Summary and Outlook” and “Significant Events”, under the\nheadings “Key Priorities for 2025” and “Operating Environment and Outlook” for the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and\nWholesale Banking segments, and under the heading “2024 Accomplishments and Focus for 2025” for the Corporate segment, each as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly\nreports to shareholders.\nAny forward-looking statements contained in this document represent the views of management only as of the date hereof and are presented for the purpose of assisting the Bank’s\nshareholders and analysts in understanding the Bank’s financial position, objectives and priorities and anticipated financial performance as at and for the periods ended on the dates\npresented, and may not be appropriate for other purposes. The Bank does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from\ntime to time by or on its behalf, except as required under applicable securities legislation.\nThis document was reviewed by the Bank’s Audit Committee and was approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors, on the Audit Committee’s recommendation, prior to its release."
